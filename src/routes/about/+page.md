# Namaste, I’m Priyanshu <span class="emoji">👋</span>

I was born in India and grew up curious about technology and science—often curious enough to break things.

Once, I connected a battery directly to the main circuit. It exploded and took out the lighting in our house. It sounds funny now. At the time, it was just curiosity moving faster than caution.

As a kid, my mother jokingly called me _mechanic_. I kept opening things—heaters, televisions, anything with screws—just to see what was inside.

### Early curiosity

We had a computer at home that my father had assembled himself. It ran Windows XP, later Windows 7, on a Pentium 4 with 1 GB of RAM. It was slow for games, but fast enough for learning.

I wrote my first program around the age of seven. It was a small text-to-speech script that ran on startup and said hello. That moment—making a machine speak—stuck with me.

Trying to play newer games, I once reinstalled Windows and accidentally wiped the entire drive, including our only backup of childhood photos. Panic followed. Then research. I spent hours learning about file systems and recovery tools and managed to recover most of the data from a raw disk.

That experience taught me two things early: computers are fragile, and understanding them matters.

### Learning by trying (and failing)

I went deeper into tech by trying everything. I started a YouTube channel to help people install custom skins, programs, and games. It didn’t last, but it taught me video editing and how to explain things.

One day, while I was playing GTA San Andreas, my father casually said, _“Why don’t you build games instead of playing them?”_  
That sentence changed how I thought.

I discovered Unity and started making small indie games—mostly unfinished. I followed an excellent [Unity beginner playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPV2KyIb3jR53Jce9hP7G5xC4O9AgnOuL) and learned by shipping half-finished ideas.

After that, I briefly tried Android development with Java (skipped), then blogging on platforms like Blogger. I wanted to earn through ads. That failed too—but it introduced me to [writing](/blog) and web development.

Web felt different. Faster. Shareable. I could build something and show it to friends instantly.

I didn’t know about GitHub back then. I learned hosting by trial and error, doing small online tasks and earning my first $10 at the age of 13. It wasn’t about the money—it was proof that things I built had value.

### How I think now

I was never great at school. I cared more about building things than scoring well. Physics fascinated me. Systems fascinated me even more.

Over time, my focus shifted from learning tools to understanding how things work end to end—software, infrastructure, products, and people. I don’t build primarily to make money. I build because making things is how I think.

### Today

Recently, I worked at a startup building a unified API gateway. Alongside that, I started my own studio, [P8labs](https://github.com/p8labs), as a place to organize and ship independent products.

I write about technology and systems on platforms like [Dev.to](https://dev.to/priyanshuverma), where my work has reached thousands of readers. I’m involved with a few non-profits and draw inspiration from stoic ideas—especially clarity, restraint, and long-term thinking.

Lately, I’ve been exploring electronics and low-level programming, which led to projects like [Piperpad](/projects/piperpad). I still spend too much time watching Linux installation videos and experimenting with operating systems.

### How I work

I like clear goals, honest constraints, and minimal process.

I do my best work in small teams, with written communication and room to think. I’m comfortable navigating ambiguity and tend to do well when there’s space to experiment and iterate quietly.

I care about building things that age well.
