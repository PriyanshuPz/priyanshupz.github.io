# User Manual

This is a playbook on how I think, work, and operate.  
It captures my tendencies, strengths, weaknesses, and the principles I try to follow.

### 🏠 Overview

- **Technologist by curiosity**: I’ve been breaking and rebuilding things since childhood. I learn best by opening systems up and seeing how they work.
- **Systems-oriented**: I naturally think in systems—software, infrastructure, products, and people.
- **Independent builder**: I’m most comfortable when I have ownership, room to experiment, and space to think.
- **Stoicism-influenced**: I value clarity, restraint, and long-term thinking over urgency and noise.

### 👍 Strengths

- **Systems thinking**  
  I like reducing complexity into understandable systems. This helps me reason clearly and make durable decisions.

- **Cross-disciplinary**  
  I operate comfortably across engineering, product, and writing. I enjoy connecting ideas across domains.

- **Learning fast**  
  I pick things up quickly by building, breaking, and iterating. I’m comfortable being wrong early.

- **Persistence**  
  I don’t give up easily. If something breaks, I’ll usually dig until I understand why.

### 👎 Weaknesses

- **Working without context**  
  I struggle when decisions are made without enough background or reasoning. Context matters to me.

- **Overthinking early**  
  My brain sometimes skips simple solutions and jumps ahead too quickly. Gentle constraints help.

- **Too many interests**  
  I get excited by many ideas and can spread myself thin if I’m not careful.

### 🛠 Principles

- **Clarity over cleverness**  
  Simple, understandable systems beat impressive but fragile ones.

- **Bias toward building**  
  The fastest way to learn is to make something real, even if it’s rough.

- **Long-term thinking**  
  I prefer decisions that age well over ones that optimize for short-term wins.

- **Write things down**  
  Writing is how I think. Notes, docs, and essays help surface better ideas.

- **Keep it minimal**  
  Process, tools, and abstractions should exist for a reason—not by default.

- **Learning in public**  
  I tend to understand things better when I share what I’m learning.

### 🩷 How I like to work

- Small teams or solo
- Written communication over meetings
- Asynchronous by default
- Clear goals, flexible paths
- Time blocked for deep work and exploration

I do my best work when I’m trusted to manage my own time and process.

### 💬 Feedback & communication

- I appreciate **direct, specific feedback**
- Early feedback is better than late feedback
- I don’t take criticism personally when it’s about improving the work
- Written context before discussions helps a lot

If something feels off, I prefer to talk about it openly.

### 📚 Influences

Some people and ideas that have shaped how I think:

- Stoic philosophy
- Physics and first-principles thinking
- Builders who explain _why_, not just _how_
- Channels like [Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/veritasium) and [Ben Eater](https://www.youtube.com/c/BenEater)
