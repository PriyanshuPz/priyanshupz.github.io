# P8labs

P8labs is the place where most of my work lives.

It started simply — I needed a quiet home for the things I was building. Over time, it became a studio of sorts: a space to explore ideas, ship tools, and work on problems that genuinely interest me.

There wasn’t a grand plan behind it. Just a decision to keep building and to give that work a stable identity.

### What it is

P8labs is an independent technology studio focused on building thoughtful software.

Some projects begin as small curiosities. Others grow into tools people rely on. A few are long bets that I continue to shape over time.

I try not to rush that process.

Good software benefits from patience.

### How I approach building

Most of the work coming out of P8labs is shaped by a few quiet preferences:

- understand the system before adding to it
- favor durability over trends
- keep things simple where possible
- build tools that remain useful

I’m less interested in chasing attention and more interested in making things that hold up.

### Areas I naturally gravitate toward

You’ll usually find me working somewhere around:

- developer tooling
- infrastructure
- AI systems
- privacy-aware software
- productivity tools
- low-level experimentation

Not because they are fashionable — but because they are foundational.

### Independent by design

P8labs is intentionally small.

Being independent allows me to explore ideas without unnecessary pressure and to move at a pace that favors good decisions over fast ones.

Some projects stay experiments.  
Some evolve quietly.  
A few grow into something larger.

I try not to force the outcome.

### See the work

Projects are documented separately at:

That page stays more current than anything I could mirror here.

### Why it exists

At its core, P8labs is about continuing the same instinct that got me into technology in the first place — opening systems, understanding them, and building things that feel considered.

Nothing overly dramatic.

Just steady work.
